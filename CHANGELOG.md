## [1.0.0] - 03-03-2025
### First release
- Allows the user to create a `_Project` folder, with the folders
you would expect to use in a Unity project such as `Scripts`, `Materials`, 
`Scriptable Objects`, etc
- Downloads the open source packages I use the most, for example: 
[Better singletons](https://github.com/UnityCommunity/UnitySingleton.git)
